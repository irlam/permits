## 📖 HOW TO ADD LOGGING TO NEW FEATURES

When you add new features, follow this pattern:

### **At Top of File:**
```php
require __DIR__ . '/src/ActivityLogger.php';
$logger = new \Permits\ActivityLogger($db);

// If user is logged in
$logger->setUser($currentUser['id'], $currentUser['email']);
```

### **After Action:**
```php
// Quick method for common actions
$logger->logPermitCreated($id, $ref, $template);

// Or custom log
$logger->log(
    'custom_action',      // action
    'category',           // category
    'resource_type',      // resource type
    'resource_id',        // resource ID
    'Description here'    // description
);
```
