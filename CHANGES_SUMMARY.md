# Changes Summary - Email Notifications & Layout Fix

## Problem Statement
1. Email notifications not being sent when permits are submitted for approval
2. Main page layout issues - remove the bottom burger button

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Email Notification Issue ✅

**Root Cause**: 
- The email notification system was fully functional
- However, NO emails were sent because no approval recipients were configured
- This critical setup step was not clearly documented

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Created CLI Setup Tool** (`bin/setup-approval-recipients.php`)
   - Easy command-line interface to manage recipients
   - Commands: `add`, `list`, `delete`, `help`
   - Example: `php bin/setup-approval-recipients.php add "Manager" manager@example.com`

2. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`EMAIL_SETUP.md`)
   - Step-by-step setup guide
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Email flow explanation
   - Queue monitoring instructions

3. **Updated README.md**
   - Added prominent warning box about required setup
   - Clear instructions in Email Notification section
   - Updated troubleshooting section

**How to Enable Email Notifications**:
```bash
# Step 1: Add at least one approval recipient
php bin/setup-approval-recipients.php add "Manager Name" manager@company.com

# Step 2: Verify SMTP settings in .env file
# MAIL_DRIVER, MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, etc.

# Step 3: Test by submitting a permit for approval
```

### 2. Main Page Layout Issue ✅

**Root Cause**:
- Redundant mobile burger button (☰ Permits) in header
- Button opened a permit picker modal
- Modal was unnecessary since all permit templates are already displayed on the main page

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Removed burger button** from `index.php` line 164
   - Button: `<button type="button" class="btn mobile-only" id="openPermitPicker">☰ Permits</button>`

2. **Removed permit sheet modal** (lines 273-290)
   - Entire modal markup removed
   - No longer clutters the DOM

3. **Removed JavaScript handler** (lines 294-321)
   - Permit sheet toggle code removed
   - Cleaner, simpler codebase

**Result**:
- Cleaner header on mobile devices
- No redundant navigation
- Users can still see all permit templates directly on the page

## Important Notes for Repository Owner

### To Enable Email Notifications:

1. **Configure approval recipients** (CRITICAL):
   ```bash
   php bin/setup-approval-recipients.php add "Your Name" your.email@company.com
   ```

2. **Verify .env settings**:
   - MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
   - MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD
   - MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS, MAIL_FROM_NAME

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Create a test permit
   - Set status to "pending_approval"
   - Check that configured recipients receive email

4. **Monitor email queue**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM email_queue ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Main Page Changes:

The main page (index.php) now has a cleaner layout:
- No burger button on mobile
- Permit templates are clearly visible
- Simpler, more direct user experience
